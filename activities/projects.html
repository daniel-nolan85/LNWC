                  LNWC prebuilt four types of birdhouses (bluebird, flycatcher,
                  nuthatch, wren) then unassembled these, creating kits with
                  wood, screws, hinges, assembly instructions for children aged
                  6 -12. The kits were reassembled by the children with adult
                  supervision at the Lake Norman Volunteer Fire Station, where a
                  naturalist gave a viewgraph presentation on cavity nesting
                  birds. The participants took home their birdhouses and
                  information sheets. We have held two bird house builds and
                  supervised several others, usually with scout troops.

                  At the first event, LNWC purchased 200 fish attractors and
                  submerged these at 20-ft or more in various locations around
                  the lake. Within minutes after the attractors were submerged
                  there was a significant increase in the number of fish. This
                  project is conducted periodically through our state

                  LNWC set up 72 coverboards to inventory and monitor reptiles
                  and amphibians (herps) on 12 islands in Lake Norman and at
                  Reed’s Creek. Coverboards are sheets of plywood that are laid
                  on the ground to provide an attractive shelter for these
                  species. The boards are lifted periodically and the species
                  that have crawled underneath are surveyed, recorded, and
                  photographed if possible. The data collected was provided to
                  Davidson College’s Department of Biology. It was determined
                  that since nothing significant was found under the boards
                  during the research period, the study was discontinued and
                  LNWC’s Island Habitat participants will remove the coverboards
                  as part of their cleanup work.

                  LNWC designed and continues to build (with permission of NCWF

                  provide a habitat area which is lacking as lakefront areas are
                  cleared of dead trees along the shorelines by home builders.
                  The platforms are heavily used by turtles and shorebirds,
                  alike. One was also built and installed in the lake of a
                  Mooresville senior citizen community in 2012.

                  first lake region so certified by the National Wildlife

                  residents/businesses/churches/schools/libraries/parks to have

                  criteria of the NWF (food, water, cover, places to raise

                <p class="card-text">
                  Chimney Swifts (Chaetura pelagica) are in steep decline, and
                  building a nesting tower to replace chimneys that are
                  disappearing quickly in North Carolina due to capping or
                  removal is an important way to help this special bird. In 2019
                  LNWC started our Chimney Swift Tower program by building three
                  12 foot towers which will be installed at three different
                  locations around Lake Norman.

                  Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodiusare) are losing their nesting
                  habitats around Lake Norman due to development and lake
                  erosion. In 2012 to help maintain their populations, LNWC
                  started building and installing Heron platforms that would
                  both enhance existing and establish new heron rookeries.

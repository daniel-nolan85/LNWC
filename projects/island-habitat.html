                LNWC's Island Habitat program is being modeled after NCWF's and
                Duke Power's sponsored Island Habitat program™ in the rapidly
                developing Catawba River basin area. The goal is simply to
                enhance island habitats for wildlife by cleaning them of refuse
                and by erecting nesting boxes. Increased education for
                participants and the public regarding wildlife habitat
                stewardship is another positive component of this program.

                The Catawba River courses through North Carolina’s western
                foothills, one of the most rapidly developing areas of the
                state. Just recently NCWF partnered with Duke Power to bring
                attention to critical wildlife habitat along the Catawba through
                the new Island Habitat Program™. With pilot projects, like
                LNWC's Island Adoption program, throughout the Catawba River
                valley, the island program is considered a model for other
                waterways across the state.

                Improper use of islands and the surrounding waters by the
                boating public frequently results in litter that impacts
                aesthetics, and which is actually a hazard to many wildlife
                species. Ducks and geese get six-pack rings around their necks.
                Fish are trapped in plastic bags. The goal of the Island Habitat
                Program is to provide partnerships that will help keep Lake
                Norman islands clean of litter, serve as an educational tool for
                raising public awareness of the proper disposal of litter on
                public waters and lands, and work toward protecting and
                enhancing wildlife habitats. The program seeks fishing clubs,
                duck hunting groups, conservation organizations, and other
                wildlife enthusiasts to “adopt” an island. Participating groups
                agree to periodically clean up the litter from their island
                while providing data on wildlife species that inhabit their
                island and note positive and negative habitat characteristics
                and changes. In addition, shoreline stabilization with valuable
                wildlife plantings such as button bush Cephalanthus occidentalis
                . Adopting groups build or receive nesting boxes for wood ducks,
                blue birds, flycatchers, owls, bats, prothonotary warblers, etc
                to erect on the island as well as a handsome sign that denotes
                their participation in the program.
